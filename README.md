# Kinvey Angular2 SDK
[Kinvey](http://www.kinvey.com) (pronounced Kin-vey, like convey) makes it ridiculously easy for developers to setup, use and operate a cloud backend for their mobile apps. They don't have to worry about connecting to various cloud services, setting up servers for their backend, or maintaining and scaling them.

This npm package makes it very easy to connect your Angular2 app with Kinvey

## Troubleshooting
__1) I have imported the SDK into my app but I get a message that `kinvey-angular2-sdk cannot be found`. What should I do?__

Turns out, mixing JavaScript and TypeScript can be problematic when TypeScript doesn't understand the extra code. In order to get the `kinvey-angular2-sdk` to be recognized by your Angular2 app you will need to create a typings definition file. Please refer to [Typings for NPM Packages](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typings-for-npm-packages.html) on how to create a typings definition file for the `kinvey-angular2-sdk`. You will then have to refer to [Angular TypeScript Configuration](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/typescript-configuration.html) on how to integrate this typings definition file into your project. Feel free to submit a pull request to help us integrate it into the repository.

If you would prefer to just get started without creating a typings definition file you can instead write your Angular2 app with JavaScript and not TypeScript. The [Angular2 Starter](https://github.com/blacksonic/angular2-esnext-starter) is a good starting point for writing your Angular2 application with just JavaScript. You can use the `kinvey-angular2-sdk` with this project without any additional setup.

## How to use

#### 1. Sign up for Kinvey
To use the SDK, sign up for Kinvey if you have not already done so. Go to the [sign up](https://console.kinvey.com/#signup) page, and follow the steps provided.

#### 2. Install the SDK
You can install the module using npm:

```bash
npm install kinvey-angular2-sdk --save
```

#### 3. Configure the SDK
Import the SDK in your code.

```javascript
import Kinvey from 'kinvey-angular2-sdk';
```

Next, use `Kinvey.initialize` to configure your app. Replace `<appKey>` and `<appSecret>` with your apps app key and secret. You can find these for your app using the [Kinvey Console App](https://console.kinvey.com).

```javascript
Kinvey.initialize({
  appKey: '<appKey>',
  appSecret: '<appSecret>'
})
  .then((activeUser) => {
    // ...
  });
```
